[Kanata](https://github.com/jtroo/kanata) is my preferred implementation. It's cross platform and doesn't impose hardware requirements. Follow the steps on [this](https://github.com/jtroo/kanata/releases) page for your OS then use [echo.kbd](echo.kbd) as your config file.

Important notes:

We added a key so we had to remove a key. To type '/' press ';' + '.' at the same time.

Similarly pressing '\[' + '\]' will toggle a Qwerty layer.

Magic rules:
```
u* -> ue
y* -> yp
a* -> ao
k* -> ks
q* -> quen
.* -> ...
_s* -> _sk
ou* -> ou'

else repeat
```
